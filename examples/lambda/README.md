This example deploys Kosli reporter to track what is running in a specific version of an AWS Lambda function. Assume your Kosli organisation name is `my_org`, Kosli environment name is `staging`, the AWS Lambda function name is `my_lambda_function` and you want to track function version number `2`. To report what is running in the latest Lambda function just omit `kosli_command_optional_parameters` variable.
